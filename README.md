# BigBrainStorm
This projeckt is made only for iPhones.
The idea is to represent a graph and be able to modify it. The project reads and writes current visualization of the graph.
Nodes can be moved with multitouch.
Double tap on node opens its edit menu. It's possible to change name, shape, color, size, connections with other nodes and delete it.
